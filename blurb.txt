Trumpkov! Utilising Markov chain generation by analyzing the frequency of words and those that follow them from actual speeches. By doing so, we can generate super, very, hyper realistic speeches from the 45th U.S. president himself. The employment of grammar and readability checks also ensures that you can't tell the difference. Try to figure out if one, both, or neither of the speeches are real or generated by a computer. Every fake speech is generated per request so they can't be memorized. Answers are also stored server-side so you can't cheat. So, take on the challenge and see if you can beat the computer...
